# Math & Statistics for Machine Learning 📘

This repository contains my notes, implementations, and practice problems on **Mathematics and Statistics** concepts essential for Machine Learning.  
It’s a personal learning journey where I document formulas, derivations, visualizations, and Python implementations to strengthen my ML foundations.
